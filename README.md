Moving down in this page we have a direct access to the available cities. Below, the user can watch an ilustrative carousel with some of our popular MyTineraries. If you click any of this images, the user will be redirected to the cities page.

### Cities Page

The cities page has a list of the available cities with a short description of each one when the user do a mouse over action and a searcher that helps to find your preferred city introducing the name literally. If no results where founded, the App will let you know with a message.

Entering Any of the available cities, the user will found a representative picture of the city and some cards (if available) with the itineraries information. Pressing the button "View More", unfolds the Itinerary activities that the user recommends to do. The user can, if it's logged, like it (clicking in the empty heart icon) and leave a comment if they want.
